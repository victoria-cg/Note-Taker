# Note Taker 

## Description
The note taker application allows users to write and read notes to create a to-do list. The application provided an opportunity to learn about the functionality of API routes and how to use an express.js server. It uses starter front end code from the UT Coding Bootcamp, and I have added the API routes.


## Installation

The app is a deployed website, and can be used at the site URL without installing anything.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To use the app, click the get started button as pictured in the screenshot, and enter the notes you wish to save.  The newly written notes will be shown on screen once saved. The app can be acessed at the following URL: https://polar-wildwood-78954-0e40ca0d7bc7.herokuapp.com/
